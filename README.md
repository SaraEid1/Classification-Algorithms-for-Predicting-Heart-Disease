## Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Classification Algorithms for Predicting Heart Disease
This project explores the performance of various machine learning algorithms —Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and AdaBoost—in the task of predicting heart disease. Through meticulous hyperpa- rameter optimization, the analysis identifies the optimal configurations for each model. The findings demonstrate that KNN, with its tailored parameters, outper- forms its counterparts in accuracy, establishing itself as a potentially powerful asset for clinical decision-making in the early detection of heart disease. Challenges such as limited dataset size and potential model biases highlight the need for further research and data diversification to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability.
